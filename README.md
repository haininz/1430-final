# Instructions for Running the Code

In order to run our code, you will need to cd into this directory and create a conda environment, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, you will need to download the weights for the Microsoft cvt13 model from this google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wb1z9d_Nr4nKKYaevBym684xYGpvJRhY/view, and the weights for the keras model from this repo: https://huggingface.co/Emmawang/mobilenet_v2_fake_image_detection/tree/main.

Then, you should be ready to run our code! Each person worked on one model, and their code for running and evaluating that model is in the folder named after them.
